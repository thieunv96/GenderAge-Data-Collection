## Overview

> CamGear supports a diverse range of video streams which can handle/control video stream almost any IP/USB Cameras,  multimedia video file format ([_upto 4k tested_](https://github.com/abhiTronix/vidgear/blob/62f32ad6663c871ec6aa4890ca1b55cd1286511a/vidgear/tests/benchmark_tests/test_benchmark_playback.py#L31-L71)), any network stream URL such as `http(s), rtp, rtsp, rtmp, mms, etc.` In addition to this, it also supports [Gstreamer's RAW pipelines](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/frequently-asked-questions/using.html) and various live video streaming sites like YouTube, Twitch, Dailymotion etc.

CamGear API provides a flexible, high-level multi-threaded wrapper around OpenCV's *[VideoCapture API](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html#a57c0e81e83e60f36c83027dc2a188e80)* with direct access to almost all of its available [*parameters*](../advanced/source_params/). It relies on [**Threaded Queue mode**](../../../bonus/TQM/) for threaded, error-free and synchronized frame handling.

CamGear internally implements [`yt_dlp`][yt_dlp] backend class for seamlessly pipelining live video-frames and metadata from various streaming services like [YouTube](../usage/#using-camgear-with-youtube-videos), [Twitch](../usage/#using-camgear-with-streaming-websites), and [many more âž¶](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md#supported-sites)

!!! tip "Helpful Tips"

	* If you're already familar with [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) library, then see [Switching from OpenCV âž¶](../../../switch_from_cv/#switching-videocapture-apis)

	* It is advised to enable logging(`logging = True`) on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.

	* You can use `framerate` class variable to retrieve framerate of the input source. Its usage example can be found [here âž¶](../../writegear/compression/usage/#using-compression-mode-with-controlled-framerate)
