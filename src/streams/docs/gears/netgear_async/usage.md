# NetGear_Async API Usage Examples:


!!! tip "Helpful Tips"

    * It is advised to enable logging(`logging = True`) on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.

    * It is advised to comprehend [NetGear API](../../netgear/overview/) before using this API.

!!! example "After going through following Usage Examples, Checkout more bonus examples [here âž¶](../../../help/netgear_async_ex/)"


## Requirement

NetGear_Async API is the part of `asyncio` package of VidGear, thereby you need to install VidGear with asyncio support as follows:

```sh
pip install vidgear[asyncio]
```

&thinsp;


## Bare-Minimum Usage

Following is the bare-minimum code you need to get started with NetGear_Async API:

### Server's End

Open your favorite terminal and execute the following python code:

!!! tip "You can terminate stream on both side anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
import asyncio

# initialize Server with suitable source
server = NetGear_Async(source="/home/foo/foo1.mp4").launch()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # set event loop
    asyncio.set_event_loop(server.loop)
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        server.loop.run_until_complete(server.task)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass
    finally:
        # finally close the server
        server.close()
```

### Client's End

Then open another terminal on the same system and execute the following python code and see the output:

!!! warning "Client will throw TimeoutError if it fails to connect to the Server in given [`timeout`](../params/#timeout) value!"

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
import cv2, asyncio

# define and launch Client with `receive_mode=True`
client = NetGear_Async(receive_mode=True).launch()


# Create a async function where you want to show/manipulate your received frames
async def main():
    # loop over Client's Asynchronous Frame Generator
    async for frame in client.recv_generator():

        # do something with received frames here

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF

        # await before continuing
        await asyncio.sleep(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set event loop to client's
    asyncio.set_event_loop(client.loop)
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        client.loop.run_until_complete(main())
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass

    # close all output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    # safely close client
    client.close()
```

## Using NetGear_Async with Variable Parameters

### Client's End

Open a terminal on Client System _(where you want to display the input frames received from the Server)_ and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Note down the local IP-address of this system(required at Server's end) and also replace it in the following code. You can follow [this FAQ](../../../help/netgear_faqs/#how-to-find-local-ip-address-on-different-os-platforms) for this purpose."

!!! warning "Client will throw TimeoutError if it fails to connect to the Server in given [`timeout`](../params/#timeout) value!"

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python hl_lines="7-12"
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
import cv2, asyncio

# define and launch Client with `receive_mode=True`. #change following IP address '192.168.x.xxx' with yours
client = NetGear_Async(
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=2,
    receive_mode=True,
    logging=True,
).launch()


# Create a async function where you want to show/manipulate your received frames
async def main():
    # loop over Client's Asynchronous Frame Generator
    async for frame in client.recv_generator():

        # do something with received frames here

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF

        # await before continuing
        await asyncio.sleep(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set event loop to client's
    asyncio.set_event_loop(client.loop)
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        client.loop.run_until_complete(main())
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass

    # close all output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    # safely close client
    client.close()
```

### Server's End

Now, Open the terminal on another Server System _(with a webcam connected to it at index `0`)_, and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Replace the IP address in the following code with Client's IP address you noted earlier."

!!! tip "You can terminate stream on both side anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python hl_lines="7-12"
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
import asyncio

# initialize Server with suitable source
server = NetGear_Async(
    source=0,
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=2,
    logging=True,
).launch()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # set event loop
    asyncio.set_event_loop(server.loop)
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        server.loop.run_until_complete(server.task)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass
    finally:
        # finally close the server
        server.close()
```

## Using NetGear_Async with a Custom Source(OpenCV)

NetGear_Async allows you to easily define your own custom Source at Server-end that you want to use to transform your frames before sending them onto the network. 

Let's implement a bare-minimum example with a Custom Source using NetGear_Async API and OpenCV:

### Server's End

Open your favorite terminal and execute the following python code:

!!! tip "You can terminate stream on both side anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python hl_lines="14-31 38"
# import library
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
import cv2, asyncio

# initialize Server without any source
server = NetGear_Async(source=None, logging=True)

# !!! define your own video source here !!!
# Open any video stream such as live webcam
# video stream on first index(i.e. 0) device
stream = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Create a async frame generator as custom source
async def my_frame_generator():

    # loop over stream until its terminated
    while True:

        # read frames
        (grabbed, frame) = stream.read()

        # check if frame empty
        if not grabbed:
            break

        # do something with the frame to be sent here

        # yield frame
        yield frame
        # sleep for sometime
        await asyncio.sleep(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # set event loop
    asyncio.set_event_loop(server.loop)
    # Add your custom source generator to Server configuration
    server.config["generator"] = my_frame_generator()
    # Launch the Server
    server.launch()
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        server.loop.run_until_complete(server.task)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass
    finally:
        # close stream
        stream.release()
        # finally close the server
        server.close()
```

### Client's End

Then open another terminal on the same system and execute the following python code and see the output:

!!! warning "Client will throw TimeoutError if it fails to connect to the Server in given [`timeout`](../params/#timeout) value!"

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
import cv2, asyncio

# define and launch Client with `receive_mode=True`
client = NetGear_Async(receive_mode=True, logging=True).launch()


# Create a async function where you want to show/manipulate your received frames
async def main():
    # loop over Client's Asynchronous Frame Generator
    async for frame in client.recv_generator():

        # {do something with received frames here}

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF

        # await before continuing
        await asyncio.sleep(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set event loop to client's
    asyncio.set_event_loop(client.loop)
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        client.loop.run_until_complete(main())
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass

    # close all output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    # safely close client
    client.close()
```

## Using NetGear_Async with Other Gears

NetGear_Async can be used with any other Gears without any compatibility issues. 

Let's implement a bare-minimum example where we are sending [Stabilized](../../stabilizer/overview/) frames from Server-end and saving them at Client's end with [WriteGear](../../writegear/introduction/) as follows:

### Server's End

Open your favorite terminal and execute the following python code:

!!! tip "You can terminate stream on both side anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python hl_lines="7"
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
import asyncio

# initialize Server with suitable source and enable stabilization
server = NetGear_Async(
    source="/home/foo/foo1.mp4", stabilize=True, logging=True
).launch()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # set event loop
    asyncio.set_event_loop(server.loop)
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        server.loop.run_until_complete(server.task)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass
    finally:
        # finally close the server
        server.close()
```

### Client's End

Then open another terminal on the same system and execute the following python code and see the output:

!!! warning "Client will throw TimeoutError if it fails to connect to the Server in given [`timeout`](../params/#timeout) value!"

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import libraries
from vidgear.gears.asyncio import NetGear_Async
from vidgear.gears import WriteGear
import cv2, asyncio

# define and launch Client with `receive_mode=True`
client = NetGear_Async(receive_mode=True).launch()
# Define writer with output filename 'Output.mp4'
writer = WriteGear(output="Output.mp4", logging=True)


# Create a async function where you want to show/manipulate your received frames
async def main():
    # loop over Client's Asynchronous Frame Generator
    async for frame in client.recv_generator():

        # {do something with received frames here}

        # write a modified frame to writer
        writer.write(frame)

        # Show output window
        cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)
        key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF

        # await before continuing
        await asyncio.sleep(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set event loop to client's
    asyncio.set_event_loop(client.loop)
    try:
        # run your main function task until it is complete
        client.loop.run_until_complete(main())
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        # wait for interrupts
        pass

    # close all output window
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    # safely close client
    client.close()
    # safely close writer
    writer.close()
```
