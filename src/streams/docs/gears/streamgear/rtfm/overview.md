# StreamGear API: Real-time Frames Mode

## Overview

When no valid input is received on [`-video_source`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of [`stream_params`](../../params/#supported-parameters) dictionary parameter, StreamGear API activates this mode where it directly transcodes real-time [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy-ndarray) video-frames _(as opposed to a entire video file)_ into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for adaptive streaming. 

This mode works exceptionally well when you desire to flexibility manipulate or transform video-frames in real-time before sending them onto FFmpeg Pipeline for processing. But on the downside, StreamGear **DOES NOT** automatically maps video-source's audio to generated streams with this mode. You need to manually assign separate audio-source through [`-audio`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of `stream_params` dictionary parameter.

SteamGear supports both [**MPEG-DASH**](https://www.encoding.com/mpeg-dash/) _(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, ISO/IEC 23009-1)_  and [**Apple HLS**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming) _(HTTP Live Streaming)_ with this mode.

For this mode, StreamGear API provides exclusive [`stream()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.stream) method for directly trancoding video-frames into streamable chunks. 

&emsp;

??? new "New in v0.2.2" 

    Apple HLS support was added in `v0.2.2`.


!!! alert "Real-time Frames Mode is NOT Live-Streaming."

    Rather, you can easily enable live-streaming in Real-time Frames Mode by using StreamGear API's exclusive [`-livestream`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of `stream_params` dictionary parameter. Checkout its [usage example here](../usage/#bare-minimum-usage-with-live-streaming).


!!! danger 

    * Using [`transcode_source()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.transcode_source) function instead of [`stream()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.stream) in Real-time Frames Mode will instantly result in **`RuntimeError`**!

    * **NEVER** assign anything to [`-video_source`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of [`stream_params`](../../params/#supported-parameters) dictionary parameter, otherwise [Single-Source Mode](../#a-single-source-mode) may get activated, and as a result, using [`stream()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.stream) function will throw **`RuntimeError`**!

    * You **MUST** use [`-input_framerate`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute to set exact value of input framerate when using external audio in this mode, otherwise audio delay will occur in output streams.

    * Input framerate defaults to `25.0` fps if [`-input_framerate`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute value not defined.
