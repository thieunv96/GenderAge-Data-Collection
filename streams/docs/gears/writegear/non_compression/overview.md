## Overview


When [`compression_mode`](../params/#compression_mode) parameter is disabled (.i.e `compression_mode = False`), WriteGear API uses basic OpenCV's inbuilt [**VideoWriter API**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dd/d9e/classcv_1_1VideoWriter.html#ad59c61d8881ba2b2da22cff5487465b5) tools for encoding multimedia files but without compression.

This mode provides flexible access to [**OpenCV's VideoWriter API**](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dd/d9e/classcv_1_1VideoWriter.html#ad59c61d8881ba2b2da22cff5487465b5),and also supports various parameters available within this API, but lacks the ability to control output quality, compression, and other important features like _lossless video compression, audio encoding, etc._ which are only available in [Compression Mode](../../compression/overview/). Thereby, the resultant output video-file size will be many times larger as compared to Compression Mode.


&nbsp; 


!!! info "Important Information"
		
	* In case WriteGear API fails to detect valid FFmpeg executables on your system, it will automatically switches to this(Non-Compression) Mode.

	* It is advised to enable logging(`logging = True`) on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.
