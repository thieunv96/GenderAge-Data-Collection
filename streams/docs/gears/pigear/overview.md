## Overview

> PiGear is similar to [CamGear API](../../camgear/overview/) but exclusively made to support various Raspberry Pi Camera Modules _(such as OmniVision OV5647 Camera Module and Sony IMX219 Camera Module)_.

PiGear provides a flexible multi-threaded framework around complete [picamera](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/index.html) python library, and provide us the ability to exploit almost all of its parameters like `brightness, saturation, sensor_mode, iso, exposure, etc.` effortlessly. Furthermore, PiGear also supports multiple camera modules, such as in the case of Raspberry-Pi Compute Module IO boards.

Best of all, PiGear contains ==Threaded Internal Timer== - that silently keeps active track of any frozen-threads/hardware-failures and exit safely, if any does occur. That means that if you're running PiGear API in your script and someone accidentally pulls the Camera-Module cable out, instead of going into possible kernel panic, API will exit safely to save resources.

!!! error "Make sure to [enable Raspberry Pi hardware-specific settings](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/quickstart.html) prior using this API, otherwise nothing will work."

!!! tip "Helpful Tips"

	* If you're already familar with [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) library, then see [Switching from OpenCV âž¶](../../../switch_from_cv/#switching-videocapture-apis)

	* It is advised to enable logging(`logging = True`) on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.
