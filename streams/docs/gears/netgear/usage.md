# NetGear API Usage Examples:

!!! danger Important Information

    * Kindly go through each given examples thoroughly, any incorrect settings/parameter may result in errors or no output at all.

    * NetGear provides auto-termination feature, where if you terminate server end manually, the connected client(s) end will also terminate themselves to save resources.

    * Only either of two functions (i.e. `send()` and `recv()`) can be accessed at any given instance based on activated [primary mode](../overview/#primary-modes) selected during NetGear API initialization. Trying to access wrong function in incorrect mode (_for e.g using `send()` function in Receive Mode_), will result in `ValueError`.

&thinsp;


## Bare-Minimum Usage

Following is the bare-minimum code you need to get started with NetGear API:

### Server's End

Open your favorite terminal and execute the following python code:

!!! tip "You can terminate both sides anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import VideoGear
from vidgear.gears import NetGear

# open any valid video stream(for e.g `test.mp4` file)
stream = VideoGear(source="test.mp4").start()

# Define Netgear Server with default parameters
server = NetGear()

# loop over until KeyBoard Interrupted
while True:

    try:

        # read frames from stream
        frame = stream.read()

        # check for frame if Nonetype
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # send frame to server
        server.send(frame)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        break

# safely close video stream
stream.stop()

# safely close server
server.close()
```

### Client's End

Then open another terminal on the same system and execute the following python code and see the output:

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import NetGear
import cv2


# define Netgear Client with `receive_mode = True` and default parameter
client = NetGear(receive_mode=True)

# loop over
while True:

    # receive frames from network
    frame = client.recv()

    # check for received frame if Nonetype
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the frame here}

    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# safely close client
client.close()
```

## Using NetGear with Variable Parameters

### Client's End

Open a terminal on Client System _(where you want to display the input frames received from the Server)_ and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Note down the local IP-address of this system(required at Server's end) and also replace it in the following code. You can follow [this FAQ](../../../help/netgear_faqs/#how-to-find-local-ip-address-on-different-os-platforms) for this purpose."

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python hl_lines="6 11-17"
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import NetGear
import cv2

# define various tweak flags
options = {"flag": 0, "copy": False, "track": False}

# Define Netgear Client at given IP address and define parameters 
# !!! change following IP address '192.168.x.xxx' with yours !!!
client = NetGear(
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=1,
    receive_mode=True,
    logging=True,
    **options
)

# loop over
while True:

    # receive frames from network
    frame = client.recv()

    # check for received frame if Nonetype
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the frame here}

    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# safely close client
client.close()
```

### Server's End

Now, Open the terminal on another Server System _(with a webcam connected to it at index `0`)_, and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Replace the IP address in the following code with Client's IP address you noted earlier."

!!! tip "You can terminate stream on both side anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python hl_lines="6 14-19"
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import VideoGear
from vidgear.gears import NetGear

# define various tweak flags
options = {"flag": 0, "copy": False, "track": False}

# Open live video stream on webcam at first index(i.e. 0) device
stream = VideoGear(source=0).start()

# Define Netgear server at given IP address and define parameters 
# !!! change following IP address '192.168.x.xxx' with client's IP address !!!
server = NetGear(
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=1,
    logging=True,
    **options
)

# loop over until KeyBoard Interrupted
while True:

    try:
        # read frames from stream
        frame = stream.read()

        # check for frame if Nonetype
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # send frame to server
        server.send(frame)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        break

# safely close video stream
stream.stop()

# safely close server
server.close()
```

## Using NetGear with OpenCV

You can easily use NetGear directly with any Video Processing library such as OpenCV itself. The complete usage example is as follows:

### Client's End

Open a terminal on Client System _(where you want to display the input frames received from the Server)_ and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Note down the local IP-address of this system(required at Server's end) and also replace it in the following code. You can follow [this FAQ](../../../help/netgear_faqs/#how-to-find-local-ip-address-on-different-os-platforms) for this purpose."

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import NetGear
import cv2

# define tweak flags
options = {"flag": 0, "copy": False, "track": False}

# Define Netgear Client at given IP address and define parameters 
# !!! change following IP address '192.168.x.xxx' with yours !!!
client = NetGear(
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=0,
    receive_mode=True,
    logging=True,
    **options
)

# loop over
while True:

    # receive frames from network
    frame = client.recv()

    # check for received frame if Nonetype
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the received frame here}

    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# safely close client
client.close()
```

### Server's End

Now, Open the terminal on another Server System _(with a webcam connected to it at index `0`)_, and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Replace the IP address in the following code with Client's IP address you noted earlier."

!!! tip "You can terminate stream on both side anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import NetGear
import cv2

# Open suitable video stream, such as webcam on first index(i.e. 0)
stream = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# define tweak flags
options = {"flag": 0, "copy": False, "track": False}

# Define Netgear Client at given IP address and define parameters 
# !!! change following IP address '192.168.x.xxx' with yours !!!
client = NetGear(
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=0,
    logging=True,
    **options
)

# loop over until KeyBoard Interrupted
while True:

    try:
        # read frames from stream
        (grabbed, frame) = stream.read()

        # check for frame if not grabbed
        if not grabbed:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # send frame to server
        server.send(frame)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        break

# safely close video stream
stream.release()

# safely close server
server.close()
```

## Using NetGear with Other VideoCapture Gears

You can use any VideoCapture Gear in the similar manner. Let's implement given usage example with ScreenGear:

### Client's End

Open a terminal on Client System _(where you want to display the input frames received from the Server)_ and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Note down the local IP-address of this system(required at Server's end) and also replace it in the following code. You can follow [this FAQ](../../../help/netgear_faqs/#how-to-find-local-ip-address-on-different-os-platforms) for this purpose."

!!! tip "You can terminate client anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import NetGear
import cv2

# define various tweak flags
options = {"flag": 0, "copy": False, "track": False}

# Define Netgear Client at given IP address and define parameters 
# !!! change following IP address '192.168.x.xxx' with yours !!!
client = NetGear(
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=1,
    receive_mode=True,
    logging=True,
    **options
)

# loop over
while True:

    # receive frames from network
    frame = client.recv()

    # check for received frame if Nonetype
    if frame is None:
        break

    # {do something with the frame here}

    # Show output window
    cv2.imshow("Output Frame", frame)

    # check for 'q' key if pressed
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if key == ord("q"):
        break

# close output window
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# safely close client
client.close()
```

### Server's End

Now, Open the terminal on another Server System _(let's say you want to transmit Monitor Screen Frames from a Laptop)_, and execute the following python code: 

!!! info "Replace the IP address in the following code with Client's IP address you noted earlier."

!!! tip "You can terminate stream on both side anytime by pressing ++ctrl+"C"++ on your keyboard!"

```python
# import required libraries
from vidgear.gears import ScreenGear
from vidgear.gears import NetGear

# define various tweak flags
options = {"flag": 0, "copy": False, "track": False}

# Start capturing live Monitor screen frames with default settings
stream = ScreenGear().start()

# Define Netgear server at given IP address and define parameters 
# !!! change following IP address '192.168.x.xxx' with client's IP address !!!
server = NetGear(
    address="192.168.x.xxx",
    port="5454",
    protocol="tcp",
    pattern=1,
    logging=True,
    **options
)

# loop over until KeyBoard Interrupted
while True:

    try:
        # read frames from stream
        frame = stream.read()

        # check for frame if Nonetype
        if frame is None:
            break

        # {do something with the frame here}

        # send frame to server
        server.send(frame)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        break

# safely close video stream
stream.stop()

# safely close server
server.close()
```
