## Overview

> StreamGear automates transcoding workflow for generating _Ultra-Low Latency, High-Quality, Dynamic & Adaptive Streaming Formats (such as MPEG-DASH and Apple HLS)_ in just few lines of python code. 

StreamGear provides a standalone, highly extensible, and flexible wrapper around [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/) multimedia framework for generating chunked-encoded media segments of the content.

SteamGear is an out-of-the-box solution for transcoding source videos/audio files & real-time video frames and breaking them into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments of suitable lengths. These segments make it possible to stream videos at different quality levels _(different bitrates or spatial resolutions)_ and can be switched in the middle of a video from one quality level to another â€“ if bandwidth permits â€“ on a per-segment basis. A user can serve these segments on a web server that makes it easier to download them through HTTP standard-compliant GET requests.

SteamGear currently supports [**MPEG-DASH**](https://www.encoding.com/mpeg-dash/) _(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, ISO/IEC 23009-1)_  and [**Apple HLS**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming) _(HTTP Live Streaming)_. 

SteamGear also creates a Manifest file _(such as MPD in-case of DASH)_ or a Master Playlist _(such as M3U8 in-case of Apple HLS)_ besides segments that describe these segment information _(timing, URL, media characteristics like video resolution and adaptive bit rates)_ and is provided to the client before the streaming session.

!!! alert "For streaming with older traditional protocols such as RTMP, RTSP/RTP you could use [WriteGear](../../writegear/introduction/) API instead."

&thinsp;

??? new "New in v0.2.2" 

    Apple HLS support was added in `v0.2.2`.


!!! danger "Important"
	
	* StreamGear **MUST** requires FFmpeg executables for its core operations. Follow these dedicated [Platform specific Installation Instructions âž¶](../ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

	* :warning: StreamGear API will throw **RuntimeError**, if it fails to detect valid FFmpeg executable on your system.

	* It is advised to enable logging _([`logging=True`](../params/#logging))_ on the first run for easily identifying any runtime errors.

!!! tip "Useful Links"
    
    - Checkout [this detailed blogpost](https://ottverse.com/mpeg-dash-video-streaming-the-complete-guide/) on how MPEG-DASH works.
    - Checkout [this detailed blogpost](https://ottverse.com/hls-http-live-streaming-how-does-it-work/) on how HLS works.

## Mode of Operations

StreamGear primarily operates in following independent modes for transcoding:


??? warning "Real-time Frames Mode is NOT Live-Streaming."

    Rather, you can enable live-streaming in Real-time Frames Mode by using the exclusive [`-livestream`](../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of `stream_params` dictionary parameter in StreamGear API. Checkout [this usage example](../rtfm/usage/#bare-minimum-usage-with-live-streaming) for more information.


- [**Single-Source Mode**](../ssm/overview): In this mode, StreamGear **transcodes entire video file** _(as opposed to frame-by-frame)_ into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for streaming. This mode works exceptionally well when you're transcoding long-duration lossless videos(with audio) for streaming that required no interruptions. But on the downside, the provided source cannot be flexibly manipulated or transformed before sending onto FFmpeg Pipeline for processing. 

- [**Real-time Frames Mode**](../rtfm/overview): In this mode, StreamGear directly **transcodes frame-by-frame** _(as opposed to a entire video file)_, into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for streaming. This mode works exceptionally well when you desire to flexibility manipulate or transform [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy-ndarray) frames in real-time before sending them onto FFmpeg Pipeline for processing. But on the downside, audio has to added manually _(as separate source)_ for streams.
