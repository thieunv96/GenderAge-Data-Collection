## Overview

In this mode, StreamGear transcodes entire audio-video file _(as opposed to frames-by-frame)_ into a sequence of multiple smaller chunks/segments for adaptive streaming. 

This mode works exceptionally well when you're transcoding long-duration lossless videos(with audio) files for streaming that requires no interruptions. But on the downside, the provided source cannot be flexibly manipulated or transformed before sending onto FFmpeg Pipeline for processing.

SteamGear supports both [**MPEG-DASH**](https://www.encoding.com/mpeg-dash/) _(Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, ISO/IEC 23009-1)_  and [**Apple HLS**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming) _(HTTP Live Streaming)_ with this mode.

For this mode, StreamGear API provides exclusive [`transcode_source()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.transcode_source) method to easily process audio-video files into streamable chunks.

This mode can be easily activated by assigning suitable video path as input to [`-video_source`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute of [`stream_params`](../../params/#stream_params) dictionary parameter, during StreamGear initialization.

&emsp;

??? new "New in v0.2.2" 

    Apple HLS support was added in `v0.2.2`.


!!! warning 

    * Using [`stream()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.stream) function instead of [`transcode_source()`](../../../../bonus/reference/streamgear/#vidgear.gears.streamgear.StreamGear.transcode_source) in Single-Source Mode will instantly result in **`RuntimeError`**!
    * Any invalid value to the [`-video_source`](../../params/#a-exclusive-parameters) attribute will result in **`AssertionError`**!
