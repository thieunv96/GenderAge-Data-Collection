# WriteGear API: Compression Mode

## Overview

When [`compression_mode`](../params/#compression_mode) parameter is enabled (.i.e `compression_mode = True`), WriteGear API provides a complete, flexible & robust wrapper around [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/) to encode lossless & compressed multimedia files.

This mode can process real-time video frames into a lossless compressed format with any suitable setting video/audio properties such as _bitrate, codec, framerate, resolution, subtitles, and much more_ in just a few easy lines of code. It can also perform complex tasks such as [Live-Streaming](../usage/#using-compression-mode-for-live-streaming) _(such as for Twitch)_, multiplexing video with audio in real-time (see this [usage example](../usage/#using-compression-mode-with-live-audio-input)) while handling all errors robustly.

!!! danger "Important Information"

	* WriteGear **MUST** requires FFmpeg executables for its Compression capabilities. Follow these dedicated [Installation Instructions âž¶](../advanced/ffmpeg_install/) for its installation.

	* In case WriteGear API fails to detect valid FFmpeg executables on your system _(even if Compression Mode is enabled)_, it automatically fallbacks to [Non-Compression Mode](../../non_compression/overview/).

	* It is advised to enable logging([`logging = True`](../params/#logging)) to see the FFmpeg command that is being executed in WriteGear's pipeline. This helps you debug any issues/errors easily and make suitable adjustments accordingly. 


!!! tip "You can speed up the execution time by disabling logging (.i.e [`logging = False`](../params/#logging)) for production use, and by tweaking FFmpeg parameters in [`output_params`](../params/#output_params) values. Look into [FFmpeg docs âž¶](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) for such hacks."

## Custom FFmpeg Commands in WriteGear API

WriteGear API now provides the **[`execute_ffmpeg_cmd`](../../../../bonus/reference/writegear/#vidgear.gears.writegear.WriteGear.execute_ffmpeg_cmd) Function** in Compression Mode, that enables the user to pass any custom CLI commands as an input to its internal FFmpeg Pipeline by formating it as a list. 

This function opens endless possibilities of exploiting any FFmpeg supported parameter within WriteGear, without relying on a third-party library/API to do the same, and while doing that it robustly handles all errors/warnings quietly.

!!! tip "A complete guide on `execute_ffmpeg_cmd` Function can be found [here âž¶](../advanced/cciw/)"
