## Overview

> NetGear is exclusively designed to transfer video frames synchronously and asynchronously between interconnecting systems over the network in real-time.

NetGear implements a high-level wrapper around [PyZmQ](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) python library that contains python bindings for [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) - a high-performance asynchronous distributed messaging library that provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, its system can run without a dedicated message broker. 

NetGear also enables real-time [*JPEG Frame Compression*](../advanced/compression/) capabilities for boosting performance significantly while sending video-frames over the network in real-time.

!!! quote "Lazy Pirate pattern in NetGear API"

	NetGear API now internally implements robust *Lazy Pirate pattern* (auto-reconnection) for its synchronous messaging patterns(`zmq.PAIR` & `zmq.REQ/zmq.REP`) at both Server and Client ends, where its API instead of doing a blocking receive, will:

	* Poll the socket and receive from it only when it's sure a reply has arrived.
	* Attempt to reconnect, if no reply has arrived within a timeout period.
	* Abandon the connection if there is still no reply after several requests.

	Netgear API also provides [`max_retries`](../params/#options) and [`request_timeout`](../params/#options) like attributes for controlling this polling.
 

NetGear as of now seamlessly supports three ZeroMQ messaging patterns:

- [x] [**zmq.PAIR**](https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/patterns/pair.html) _(ZMQ Pair Pattern)_ 
- [x] [**zmq.REQ/zmq.REP**](https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/patterns/client_server.html) _(ZMQ Request/Reply Pattern)_
- [x] [**zmq.PUB/zmq.SUB**](https://learning-0mq-with-pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyzmq/patterns/pubsub.html) _(ZMQ Publish/Subscribe Pattern)_

_whereas the supported protocol are: `tcp` and `ipc`_.


&thinsp;

## Modes of Operation

### Primary Modes

NetGear API primarily has two modes of operations:

* **Send Mode:** _which employs `send()` function to send video frames over the network in real-time. **Activate this mode by setting parameter [`receive_mode = False`](../params/#receive_mode).**_
  
* **Receive Mode:** _which employs `recv()` function to receive frames, sent over the network with *Send Mode* in real-time. **Activate this mode by setting parameter [`receive_mode = True`](../params/#receive_mode).**_

### Exclusive Modes

In addition to the primary modes, NetGear API also offers application-specific Exclusive Modes:

!!! tip "Also, checkout this [compatibility chart](../../../help/netgear_faqs/#what-exclusive-modes-are-compatible-with-each-other-in-netgear-api) for these modes interoperability."

#### A. Multi-Servers Mode
- In this exclusive mode, NetGear API robustly ==handles multiple servers at once==, thereby providing seamless access to frames and unidirectional data transfer from multiple Servers/Publishers across the network in real-time. 
- Each new Server on the network can be identified on the client's end by using its unique port address. 
- **You can learn about this mode [here âž¶](../advanced/multi_server/)**

#### B. Multi-Clients Mode
- In this exclusive mode, NetGear API robustly ==handles multiple clients at once==, thereby providing seamless access to frames and unidirectional data transfer to multiple Client/Consumers across the network in real-time. 
- Each new Client on the network can be uniquely identified on the Server's end by using its unique port address. 
- **You can learn about this mode [here âž¶](../advanced/multi_client/)**

#### C. Bidirectional Mode
- This exclusive mode ==provides seamless support for bidirectional data transmission== between between Server and Client along with video frames. 
- Using this mode, the user can now send or receive any data(of any datatype) between Server and Client easily in real-time. 
- **You can learn more about this mode [here âž¶](../advanced/bidirectional_mode/)**

#### D. SSH Tunneling Mode
- This exclusive mode ==allows you to connect NetGear via secure SSH connection over the untrusted network== and access its intranet services across firewalls. 
- This mode implements SSH Remote Port Forwarding which enables accessing Host(client) machine outside the network by exposing port to the public Internet. 
- **You can learn more about this mode [here âž¶](../advanced/ssh_tunnel/)**

#### E. Secure Mode
- In this exclusive mode, NetGear API ==provides easy access to powerful, smart & secure ZeroMQ's Security Layers== that enables strong encryption on data, and unbreakable authentication between the Server and Client with the help of custom certificates/keys that brings cheap, standardized privacy and authentication for distributed systems over the network. 
- **You can learn more about this mode [here âž¶](../advanced/secure_mode/)**

!!! warning "Important Information"  

	* When compiling/installing pyzmq on UNIX systems, it is generally recommended that zeromq binaries to be installed separately, via `homebrew, apt, yum, etc.` as follows:

		```sh
		# Debian-based
		sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev

		# RHEL-based
		sudo yum install libzmq3-devel

		# OSX-based
		brew install zeromq
		```

	  	_If zeromq binaries are not found, pyzmq will try to build `libzmq` as a Python Extension, though this is not guaranteed to work!_

	* It is advised to enable logging (`logging = True`) on the first run, to easily identify any runtime errors.

	* Kindly go through each given [Usage Examples](../usage/#netgear-api-usage-examples) thoroughly, any incorrect settings/parameter may result in errors or no output at all.

	* Only either of two functions (i.e. `send()` and `recv()`) can be accessed at any given instance based on activated [primary mode](#primary-modes) selected during NetGear API initialization. Trying to access wrong function in incorrect mode _(for e.g using `send()` function in Receive Mode)_, will result in `ValueError`.

	* [Frame Compression](../advanced/compression/) is enabled by default in NetGear along with fast dct and compression-quality at 90% in all connections.
