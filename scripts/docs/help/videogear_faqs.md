# VideoGear FAQs

&nbsp;

## What is VideoGear API and what does it do?

**Answer:** VideoGear provides a special internal wrapper around VidGear's exclusive [**Video Stabilizer**](../../gears/stabilizer/overview/) class. It also act as a Common API, that provided an internal access to both [CamGear](../../gears/camgear/overview/) and [PiGear](../../gears/pigear/overview/) APIs and their parameters, with a special [`enablePiCamera`](../../gears/videogear/params/#enablepicamera) boolean flag. _For more info. see [VideoGear doc âž¶](../../gears/videogear/overview/)_

## What's the need of VideoGear API?

**Answer:** VideoGear is basically ideal when you need to switch to different video sources without changing your code much. Also, it enables easy stabilization for various video-streams _(real-time or not)_  with minimum efforts and using way fewer lines of code. It also serve as backend for other powerful APIs, such [WebGear](../../gears/webgear/overview/) and [NetGear_Async](../../gears/netgear_async/overview/).

## Which APIs are accessible with VideoGear API?

**Answer:** VideoGear provided an internal access to both [CamGear](../../gears/camgear/overview/) and [PiGear](../../gears/pigear/overview/) APIs and their parameters, also it contains wrapper around [**Video Stabilizer**](../../gears/stabilizer/overview/) class.

&nbsp;

## Can we access WriteGear API or NetGear API too with VideoGear?

**Answer:** No, only selected VideoCapture APIs _(anwsered above)_ are accessible.

&nbsp;

## Does using VideoGear instead of CamGear API directly, affects performance?

**Answer:** No, there's no difference, as VideoGear just a high-level wrapper around CamGear API and without any modifications in-between.
